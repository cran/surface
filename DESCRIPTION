Description: SURFACE is a data-driven phylogenetic comparative method for fitting stabilizing selection models to continuous trait data, building on the ouch package. The main functions fit a series of Hansen models using stepwise AIC, then identify cases of convergent evolution where multiple lineages have shifted to the same adaptive peak.
