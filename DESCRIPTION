Description: surface is a data-driven phylogenetic comparative method
        for fitting stabilizing selection models to continuous trait
        data, building on the ouch package. The main function fits a
        series of Hansen models using stepwise AIC, then identifies
        cases of convergent evolution where multiple lineages have
        shifted to the same evolutionary regime.
